# HBase High Performance Cookbook
This is the code repository for [HBase High Performance Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hbase-high-performance-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783983063), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Apache HBase is a non-relational NoSQL database management system that runs on top of HDFS. It is an open source, disturbed, versioned, column-oriented store and is written in Java to provide random real-time access to big Data.

We’ll start off by ensuring you have a solid understanding the basics of HBase, followed by giving you a thorough explanation of architecting a HBase cluster as per our project specifications. Next, we will explore the scalable structure of tables and we will be able to communicate with the HBase client. After this, we’ll show you the intricacies of MapReduce and the art of performance tuning with HBase. Following this, we’ll explain the concepts pertaining to scaling with HBase. Finally, you will get an understanding of how to integrate HBase with other tools such as ElasticSearch.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<configuration>
<property>
    <name>fs.default.name</name>
    <value>hdfs://addressofbsdnsofmynamenode-hadoop:9001</value>
 </property>
</configuration>

```

This book not only gives you how to setup a large scale HBase cluster , using commodity hardware , but also talks about how to use the full potential of cloud like AWS. 
It also talk about the internal process of HBase and how it connects to each other in a perfect synchronized way enabling it to scale without compromising the performance.
We tried to simplify thing as much as we can with multiple examples and details where it's needed.
In the end it talks about Machine learning, text analysis using Solr and ElasticSearch.
